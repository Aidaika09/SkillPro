2. Create a simple express app
    a. Create the app - done.

    b. Add a route: 
    What happens if you open http://localhost:3001/? Why?

    It shows: Cannot GET / Error, because there is no route defined for the root path (/)

    Fix this - it should show some text and a link to the /hello site instead of an error. - fixed in index.js.
